# Email-Spam-Detection

In this repository, I am implementing a small project to practice NLP, specifically for Email Spam classification.  The dataset used for this project is [available in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), and the implementation was based on a tutorial presented by [Greg Hogg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuvYcw_sVQ).
